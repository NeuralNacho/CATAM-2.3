# lambda z: z**3 - z**2 + (2-1j)*z - 1 - 1j  # f_1(z)
# lambda z: 3*z**2 - 2*z + 2 - 1j  # f_1'(z)
# lambda z: z**3 + z  # g(z)
# lambda z: z**3 - z**2 - z + 1  # h(z)

From progrmamming_task_2.py :
# e.g. f(z) = f_1(z) = z**3 - z**2 + (2-j)z - 1 - 1j
# Then df/dz = 3*z**2 - 2*z + 2 - 1j
# d^2f/dz^2 = 6*z - 2

# know signed curvature is det(x', x'')/|x'|^3
